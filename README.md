Ray tracing for mere mortals! Ray tracing in a weekend (or a week, or a lifetime) 

This repository is an interpretation and implementation of [Peter Shiley](https://github.com/petershirley)'s ray tracing books:
- _Ray Tracing in One Weekend_
- _Ray Tracing: The Next Week_ 
- _Ray Tracing: The Rest of Your Life_
